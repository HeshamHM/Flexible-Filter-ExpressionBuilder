## What can you add to improve the expression builder?
-  Enable the removal of specific filters from the expression builder.
- Implement optimizations to enhance the performance of the expression builder, especially for scenarios with a large dataset.
- Introduce additional filter options to cater to diverse use cases, such as range filters, date-based filters, etc.
- Implement a fluent interface for a more expressive and readable way to build filter expressions.
